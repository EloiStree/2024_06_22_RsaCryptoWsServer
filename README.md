Fuck me. Crypto and RSA is a pain in the ass outside of C#


- Try to do Ethereum Sign verfied in Python... Failed
- Try to do PEM to XML in most language.. Failed
- Try to make some RSA in Unity3D.. Not supported
- Try to do Sign verified RSA in Rust.. Failed a lot's
- ...

Try to do all that in C#:
- Just download Nuget and use it

Conclusion after month of failing around on different langage.
Why not just do a C# Websocket server with all the utility needed callable from languages.
